Part 2: Good Samaritan

Due: 03/29, 11:59pm

## Before You Start

Make sure you have completed PacMan CI Part 1 before you start this project.
This is a continuation of the previous part.

- Create cards for Section 1 and assign deadlines. Create these cards in the same board as the previous part.
  - Add these deadlines on your cards on your Kanban Board to make them visible to the entire team 
 
## Introduction

In this project, you will be making an open source contribution to fix your partner team's repo. There is only one section for this project:

- Good Samaritan - FTR-fix

Now its time to fix the sabotages!

You and your team will be assigned a sabotaged repository of another team. You must fork the repository, identify the mistakes and fix the code.

Only one person from each team needs

1. Fork the assigned Repository
2. Create a Feature branch titled FTR-Fix
3. Give your team access to collaborate on the repository (including your TA!)

Once the repository has been forked, the team should

4. Analyze the failing tests
5. Divide and conquer the necessary fixes (you may want to fix the same functions you sabotaged in Part 1 and wrote for Project 2)

Each member should

6. Create a branch that is titled fix-your_name and fix their assigned functions
7. Commit and push Changes to the forked repository
8. Submit a pull request to merge your branch with the FTR-fix branch on the forked repo

Once all members have made their changes,

9. Submit a pull request to merge FTR-Fix with the main branch
10. Add all group members (of your own team) as reviewers
11. Open a Pull Request to merge the forked repository with the original repository
12. Add all members of the __other__ team as reviewers to this PR

Once all steps are complete, you should be able to see that the other team's workflow has all of its tests passing again. Finally the other team should

13. Review the Pull Request and merge the forked repository with the original repository

## Academic Integrity

Please **carefully read** the academic honesty section of the course syllabus. **Any evidence** of impermissible cooperation on projects, use of disallowed materials or resources, or unauthorized use of computer accounts, **will be** submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, or suspension or expulsion from the University. Be sure you understand what you are and what you are not permitted to do in regards to academic integrity when it comes to project assignments. These policies apply to all students, and the Student Honor Council does not consider lack of knowledge of the policies to be a defense for violating them. Full information is found in the course syllabus, which you should review before starting.
